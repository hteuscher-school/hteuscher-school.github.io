    For Starters, My name is Hudson. I am a wannabe Graphic Designer and honestly I am still pretty rusty at
    the whole thing. Some of my Inspirations are Meow Wolf, with their crazy themed and colorful locations, and
    really simplistic styles that actually make sense (Not like those companies that oversimplify their logo because
    it looks "modern" or "cool")

    Other than that I enjoy doing simple things, like playing video games or playing tabletop games such as, DND,
    Binding of Isaac 4 Souls, and Catan (Im thinking about getting into Warhammer 40K but everyone tells me it is
    an expensive hobby)
    Sometimes if I am really bored Ill just work on misc work that look cool to me, or i'll just sleep
    (I am a very sleepy sleepy person)
