    Welcome to the place Where Genius Happens! This is a website that I created to tell you a little about myself.
    Honestly the homepage Isnt going to be that interesting as Ill be going into more detail about actual things in their
    respective pages, but Ill be doing a Quick Synopsis of all of that right here.
  </p>
  <h3>A quick About Myself</h3>

  <p class="big" style="text-align: justify;">
    My Name is Hudson Teuscher, I was born in raised in Colorado, some things I do in my spare time when I am not making
    projects in the art of Graphic Design, are sleeping long amounts of time (College really did me dirty) or playing video
    games with my friends (Also a cause of the lack of sleep.) If im not doing those things I might actually be making
    video games, as I am semi good at using Unity, and am learning Unreal Engine as the time I am writing this (Oct 20, 2024)
    and yes, this is a really dumb photo of me in front of a Peppa Pig Playground inside of a mall, I think it fits here a lot
    as it tells people the kind of person I am. Generally, I am entirely laid back and tent to crack jokes at the slightest
    convience, like when I saw that Peppa Pig playground there was no way I could walk past it without taking a silly photo of
    it
